# Principles of tidy data

## Cleaning your data: One of the most important and under-appreciated stages of good data analysis

Education finance data, like all other data, rarely come to us in a format that is plug-and-play ready for analysis

A high-quality analysis of your state's school finance system must start with gathering and cleaning relevant data.

**"Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." - Hadley Wickham**

## The principles of "tidy data" provide a helpful vision of what good, clean data should look like.

Tidy data follows three rules:

1.  Each column is a variable
2.  Each row is an observation
3.  Each cell is a value

## If your data includes a variable that is embedded across several column names, use **pivot_longer()**

# State total Revenue data ----
state_total_revenue_all <- app_08_20_data |>
  select(state, state_revenue_2008, state_revenue_2009, state_revenue_2010, state_revenue_2011, 
         state_revenue_2012, state_revenue_2013, state_revenue_2014, state_revenue_2015,
         state_revenue_2016, state_revenue_2017, state_revenue_2018, state_revenue_2019, 
         state_revenue_2020) |>
pivot_longer(!state, names_to = "year", values_to = "state_total_revenue") 

state_total_revenue_all$year <- gsub('state_revenue_', '', state_total_revenue_all$year)

state_total_revenue_all <- state_total_revenue_all |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year), 
         year_2 = year - 1,
         year = paste0(year_2, "-", year)) |>
  select(-year_2)

``` 
## If your data includes data from a single observation spread across multiple rows, use **pivot_wider()**

| 3.  Mis-formatted data        | Work with functions from base R like 'as.numeric()' or from the 'tidyverse' packages like 'stringr' to clean the data that appear in a different format than you want. |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4.  Missing data and outliers | Identify where in your dataset there are missing variables and/or outliers - this may be more of an iterative process as your explore your data.                       |

# Joining datasets

## Your data will rarely come to you in a single table. You will need to join functions to merge dataframes together

To join two dataframes, they need to share a common column with a unique identifier.

State departments of education typically assign a unique ID number to each school district. **Make sure this is available in your datasets.**

Joining datasets on a name (e.g. school or district) can create problems based on:

-   Capitalization (Mcgregor v. McGregor)
-   Abbreviation (St. Paul v. Saint Paul)
-   Mis-spelling (it happens!)

## There are different ways to join datasets together, but using **left_join()** will keep your work consistent

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Once you have dataframes that share a common ID column, start with your most reliable set of data (typically student count data like ADM or enrollment) and use **left_join()** to attach additional data to that table.

This will keep the number of rows (e.g. districts or schools) consistent as you use **left_join()** to add more data.

::: {.column width="50%"}

## In-class coding example: How to use **left_join()**

```{r}

```

## As you use **left_join()** to merge dataframes together, it's helpful to use anti-join to examine missing data.

Using the **anti_join()** function from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package in R returns all rows in one data frame that do not have matching values in another data frame. Using anti_join() allows you to explore the incongruities in your data.

# An example with **tidycensus**

## The **'tidycensus'** package can provide data at the school district level that may be helpful for school finance analysis

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The Census Bureau collects a lot of information that is reported at the school district level. This includes information on topics that are relevant to school finance, like housing.

The **'tidycensus'** R package makes it easy to access, explore, and analyze Census Bureau data.
