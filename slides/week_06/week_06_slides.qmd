# Homework Review

## Solving a common problem with the homework

# What should the future of school finance equity look like?

## The variability in policies and context within and among states makes it impossible to set many hard-and-fast rules. Below are a couple of recommendations.

-   A **student-based state school funding formula** is the best starting point for transparency and equity.
-   Formulas should have **weights that allocate additional funding** for students with disabilities, English language learners, and low-income students, as well as other mechanisms to allocate funding toward school districts serving students with additional educational needs.

## Using local property tax revenue as the primary method for funding local schools sets inequity into the core of school funding, and ties school funding to the real estate market.

This is not the only way to fund schools. If a state uses local tax revenue as part of its education finance system, there must be strong equity-driven policies in place to balance revenue scales for lower-wealth districts, such as county level revenue pooling for states with smaller districts, and caps, supplementation, or redistributive policies on local tax revenue to counteract inequities created by local funding and to prevent runaway local spending in high-wealth districts.

## Questions for Advocates

Understand your state education finance system - What data can you use to show how state funding lines up with student needs, especially for low-income students, students with disabilities, and English language learners? - What kind of school funding formula does your state use? - If your state does not currently have a student-based formula, how (if at all) does the existing formula consider students' different learning needs? - If your state includes weights in its funding formula, how are those weights structured and determined? - If a student is eligible to receive multiple weights, does your state's funding formula provide for that? - How much does total funding per student vary among school districts? What differences among districts influence funding the most? - How do districts in your state allocate funding to individual schools? - Does your state have a process to conduct resource or needs assessments? Can this process be used at the district level? - How have lawsuits shaped the school finance landscape in your state? - Is there current school finance litigation in your state? If so, what are the primary arguments, what is the anticipated timeline for a ruling, and what has been the reaction of policymakers to the suit?

# Making maps with edbuildmapr

## Much like 'edbuildr', the 'edbuildmapr' package makes it eaier to perform spatial analysis of education data

-   R can use objects called "shapfiles" to create maps
-   The 'edbuildmapr' package makes it easy to produce high-quality maps as you analyze school finance data.
-   To get started, you will need to install two packages:
    -   **edbuildmapr**: Simplifies the use of school district shapefiles.

    -   **sf:** Standardizes how to encode spatial vector data.

# Setting up your data processing project

## Before you start cleaning your state's data, set yourseful up for a successful, reproducible analysis project

-   Every new data analysis proejct shoudl live in its own RStudio project
-   File -\> New Project...

![](https://bookdown.org/gmli64/do_a_data_science_project_in_10_days/Capture/NewProject.png)

## Remember: After you've created a project, use a consistent folder structure to keep your analysis organized

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlNMJ.png)

## Another layer of organization: Keep your raw data and your processed data separate!

-   Use sub-folders within your "data" folder to keep your raw data files separated from any processed data files you produce during your analysis.
-   This creates additional procedural barrier to accidentally over-writing your raw data.
-   Use the "processed" data folder for exporting clean data or results of your analysis, like summary tables.

## R Markdown is a special file type that allows you to combine code with plain text to create reports

![](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/rmdint-template.png)

## R Markdown combines "chunks" of R code with blocks of text that can be formatted using R Mardown

R code chunks in R Markdown are contained within a pair of triple backticks that include a curly brace that indicates the section contains r code:

```{r}
# <code goes here>
  
```

Markdown is a *really* easy way to format text. For more, visit [Markdown Guide.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
