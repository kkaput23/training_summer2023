Property taxes\nare the most common source of local tax revenue for public schools in large part because they provide a\nstable revenue stream compared to taxes on sales or income. These taxes can be set by counties, towns, or\nschool boards, depending on state policy.\n\n## How Property Taxes Fund Schools (2/2)\nProperty taxes are typically collected based on two variables: \n\n- Assessed value of property\n- Property tax rate, sometimes called the “mill” rate. \n\n## What does \"assessed value of property\" mean?  \nThe assessed value of a property is the dollar value used by a local government to determine how much a particular property is worth. The assessed value of a property may not always match the market value. Some local governments use an assessment rate to translate the market value of a property into taxable value.\n\n## What is the \"property tax rate\" or \"mill rate? \nThe mill rate is the number of dollars per $1,000 in assessed value that property owners will owe each year. The mill rate multiplied by assessed value equals local property tax bills. \n\nIn some instances, state policy directly shapes or limits property taxes. Some states include caps on how much mill rates can grow each year; other states limit the growth in the assessed values of properties over time. \n\n## How do property taxes produce education finance inequities? \nSchool districts generate revenue from the local property tax associated with property located within districts’ geographic boundaries. When school districts have significantly different levels of property wealth producing those tax revenues compared to one another, a massive barrier to equitable educational finance results. \n\n## Making Local School Funding More Equitable \nThe way school district boundaries are drawn and the way school funding formulas account for differences in tax capacity among districts can reflect, amplify, or mitigate property wealth inequality. State policymakers can also implement policies that directly address local funding inequity by constraining runaway local taxation by wealthier districts, compensating for local revenue differences with state funds, and/or redistributing some of those funds. Some examples include: \n\n- Capping local revenue: State policymakers can set a limit on the amount of per-pupil revenue local\ncommunities can generate for their public schools. \n- Supplementing local tax revenues in lower-wealth districts to equalize their ability to generate\nfunding: States can provide additional funding to lower-wealth districts who choose to set a higher tax\nrate to ensure they get the same revenue for their tax effort that wealthier districts get.\n- Implementing redistributive mechanisms for exceeding local revenue caps: If communities wish to\ngenerate more revenue for their local school system above the cap, policymakers can set a rule that for\nevery additional dollar generated above the cap, another dollar must be allocated to a state fund for\nschools in lower-wealth communities.\n- Enacting a statewide property tax: Moving from many locally collected taxes to a single, statewide\nproperty tax is the most direct way to address property wealth inequities among school districts.\nVermont is the only state to implement a state-level property tax system for financing education.\n\n## Questions for advocates \n\n- How do property wealth per pupil and mill rates vary by school district in your state?\n- Do school districts in your state have non-property tax local revenue sources?\n- Does state policy work to compensate for differences in local revenue capacity among districts? If so, how?\n- What policies might help improve the equity of local funding in your state\n\n# Introduction to the tidyverse\n\n## R is a functional programming language - most of what you will do in R is work with functions \n\nA function: \n\n-  Takes a specified input\n-  Performs an operation \n-  Returns an output\n\nFunctions are helpful tools to reduce repetition in typing and improves your code's \nconsistency, reliability and readability. \n\n## The tidyverse is a powerful collection of R packages - collections of functions - that work well together (1/2)\n\n- The most popular packages in the R community are past of what is called the \"tidyverse,\" which includes packages like ggplot2, tidyr, stringr, tibble, purrr\n- Tidyverse packages are built to work together. Every tidyverse package contains functons that can manipulate or visualize data that lives in data frames. \n\n## The tidyverse is a powerful collection of R packages - collections of functions - that work well together (2/2)\n\n- Most functions in the tidyverse require a data frame (R's version of a table) as the first argument in each function. The functions can be \"chained\" together with other functions. \n\nWe will explore the tidyverse by looking at EdBuild's FY2019 education data compiled from the F33 survey, SAIPE, EDGE, and CCD. The edbuildr package provides access to clean district\ndata on funding, student demographics, and wealth.\n\n## To read EdBuild's finance data into our working environment we will use the masterpull() function \n\nmasterpull(data_year = 2019, data_type = “fin”): Downloads a clean dataset from EdBuild’s server. There are three options for the data_type argument:\n\n- “geo”: only includes districts with geographic boundaries\n(no charter/special school districts) that meet EdBuild’s\ncriteria for fiscal analysis\n- “fin”: includes all districts that meet EdBuild’s criteria\nfor fiscal analysis\n- “full”: includes all districts – TO BE USED WITH\nCAUTION\n\n\n## The dplyr() package provides many functions to manipulate your data frames' columns and rows \n\nThe functions you'll most frequently use from the dplyr packages are: \n\n- select(): names columns to keep from a data frame\n- rename(): name columns to keep from a data frame \n- filter(): remove rows that do not meet the condition in the logical statement from the output\n- mutate(): create a new column that will be added to the end of your data frame. \n\n# Iterative exploratory analysis \n\n## LIVE CODING EXAMPLE: exploring_the_tidyverse.R \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load ----------\n\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(edbuildr)\n\n# Krista likes to denote which spreadsheet is raw for transparency \ndist_fy19_raw <- masterpull(data_type = \"geo\")\n\n# filter Minnesota data and clean -----\n\n# filter, rename, and mutate data for Minnesota \nmn_ed_data <- dist_fy19_raw |>\n  filter(State == \"Minnesota\") |>\n  rename(district = NAME,\n         county = County,\n         enroll = ENROLL, \n         total_local_rev = LR,\n         total_state_rev = SR,\n         total_state_local_rev = SLR, \n         urbanicity = dUrbanicity,\n         operational_schools = dOperational_schools, \n         district_type = dType, \n         white_enroll = dWhite, \n         sped_enroll = dIEP, \n         ell_enroll = dLEP, \n         econ_dis_enroll = StPov,\n         bipoc_pct = pctNonwhite, \n         pov_pct = StPovRate,\n         median_house_income = MHI, \n         median_prop_value = MPV) |>\n  mutate(bipoc_enroll = enroll - white_enroll,\n         ell_pct = ell_enroll/enroll, \n         sped_pct = sped_enroll/enroll, \n         local_rev_pp = total_local_rev/enroll,\n         state_rev_pp = total_state_rev/enroll,\n         local_state_rev_pp = total_state_local_rev/enroll) |>\n  select(district, county, enroll, local_rev_pp, state_rev_pp, local_state_rev_pp, \n         total_local_rev, total_state_rev, total_state_local_rev, urbanicity, \n         operational_schools, district_type, pov_pct, bipoc_pct, ell_pct, sped_pct)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Visual exploratory analysis \n\n## Summarizing columns can be helpful, but it can hide nuance in your data that can be better seen via plotting \n\nThe ggplot2 package is the most widely-used data visualization approach in the R ecosystem. \n\n- ggplot plots are created by starting with your data, then building up layers \n- Once your specify your data, you can add layers of \"geoms\" to create your plot \n- Today we will use geom_histogram() and geom_point()\n\n# Iterating your way to beauty with ggplot2 using Minnesota data\n\n## Step 1: Create a basic plot \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# first minnesota plot \nggplot(mn_ed_data, aes(x = pov_pct, y = local_rev_pp)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week_02_ggplot_slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Step 2: Address missing values\n\nWe need to figure out what’s going on with our missing values before we go any further!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# investigate missing values \nmn_na_dist <- mn_ed_data |>\n  filter(is.na(local_rev_pp) | is.na(pov_pct)) |>\n  arrange(district_type) \n\nview(mn_na_dist)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe missing data makes sense.
